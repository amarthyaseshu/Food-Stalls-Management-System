# project-food-stalls-management-system
This food-stalls-management system application created using java and oracle database, can be used in IT Parks and shared workspaces, in which the employee time for food will be saved.
The employee can order food for pickup, and also can view the queue at a particular food stall and manage his timings accordingly, or else directly opt for other food stalls having less queue.
There are 3 actors in this project. 1.Admin 2.Vendor and 3.Employee.
The admin can add vendors, assign a vendor ID. And can also remove vendors
The food stalls are managed by vendors, food each food stall there is a vendor. The vendor can add food items, remove, update and manage orders and queue.
